#HelloWorld

###What this is
A test repo to help get group members up to speed on Git.

***
Basics of Git:  

1. Commits: These are the most basic pieces of git. A commit is equivalent to saving your work, it is a snapshot of changes you have made to one or more files in the repository. You should commit early and often, there is no real overhead to making lots of commits. You should commit when you add a group of related changes (ex. Adding a method or properties to a class).  

2. Branches: A branch is a series of commits that are tracked as a group, branches allow work to be done on a set of files without locking out those files from other team members. Any time you plan on making changes to the code you should make a branch first, make those changes and merge them back in.  

3. Merging: This is the act of taking the commits you have made in a branch and adding them into another branch; generally the parent branch you are working off of. This allows you to add changes to the parent branch in a visible and clean way.
